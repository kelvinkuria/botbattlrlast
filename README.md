## Project Overview

In the vast universe, a galactic overlord has hired you, a talented galactic web developer, to create a web application that facilitates the management of a Bot Army.

3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
5. Create a `db.json` file in the project directory with the appropriate data structure.
6. Start the JSON server by running `json-server --watch db.json`.
7. Test your server by visiting `http://localhost:8001/bots` in your browser.
